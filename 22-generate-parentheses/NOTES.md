So I couldnt solve this problem today.
I did able to come up with the burteforce recursive solution, but I couldnt visualise it enough. - I couldnt come up with when the state space changed, and I need to look at the solution
​
Overall, I think that this problem is a bit similar to a lot of permutation problem, except that you need to validate the input before continue, and put it into the result array
